تَبَـٰرَكَ ٱلَّذِى بِيَدِهِ ٱلْمُلْكُ وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ قَدِيرٌ

"Blessed is the One in Whose Hands rests all authority. And He is Most Capable of everything."

# Arabic Breakdown

This ayah is actually composed of two sentences:

تَبَـٰرَكَ ٱلَّذِى بِيَدِهِ ٱلْمُلْكُ

"Tabaraka" is a form VI verb meaning to be blessed, and so this sentence is a compound sentence.
The next part of it is "الذ", or "the one who", and so we say "Blessed is one".

بيده translates "in his hand", and since ب is a prepositional phrase, the entire word is in the جر case.

ملك translates sovereignity, which is derived from the root "to possess" or "to control". 
Putting this all together, we get the ayah, "Blessed is He in whose hand rests all authority."

The second sentence is a little easier to translate:

وَهُوَ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ

كُلِّ شَىْءٍ translates "all things". In this case, it's preceeded by عَلَىٰ, which means upon. This is a nominal sentence,
with the subject being وَهُ, and قَدِيرٌ being a noun of intensity, meaning "All-Powerful".

# Commentary

مُلْكُ is an interesting word. It's derived from مَلُكَ, which is the word for to possess/control. The word is also used for "angel"
as well. StudyQuran says that ملك refers to Allah (swt)'s reign over the visible world, versus ملكات, which refers
to Allah (swt)'s dominion over the unseen world.  The name "Malik" also derives from the same root.
