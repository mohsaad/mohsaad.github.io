title: Photographing the Blood Moon
---

Today was an interesting day - a full moon, the second of the month (often called a blue moon) and also a lunar eclipse, which forms a cool red effect on the moon. I tried to take some pictures with it, a couple of which I got decent ones.

To get this, I had to use my (not very good) telephoto lens to the very maximum focal length (in this case, 210mm). I made the apeture as large as possible, as well as increase the shutter speed to get a clear picture. The trick was to use a fast exposure - it can't be too large, otherwise the moon will move slightly and you'll lose focus. One of the pictures that shows this is here:

To get a clear picture, I ended up exposing for 1/2 of a second, which is much faster than my usual astrophotography shoots.

I didn't bring my wide-angle lens (really should have though) so I couldn't get a good picture of the moon over the city. This one was the best I could get.

Next time I'm definitely bringing a wider lens to get a view of the city.
