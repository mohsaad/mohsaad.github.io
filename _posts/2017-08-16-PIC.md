title: A Guide to the 8259A Programmable Interrupt Controller

Here's a guide I wrote about PIC's back when I was studying operating systems. Most of the material comes from notes by [Steven Lumetta](http://lumetta.web.engr.illinois.edu/), so hopefully these benefit someone.

# Programmable Interrupt Controllers

The 8259A Programmable Interrupt Controller is a device used to connect interrupts to a processor, by signaling the processor when an interrupt occurs.

### Basic Operation
The PIC’s main function is to report interrupts to the processor. We will look at how this operation is done by examining the process when an interrupt is generated. When an interrupt is generated on one of the IR lines on the PIC, the PIC’s internal state decides whether to report the interrupt to the processor based on the interrupt’s priority. If it decides to report the interrupt, the PIC raises the INT line to high and waits for the processor. The processor then strobes (raises to low and then high again) the INTA input. When the PIC sees this, it knows to write the interrupt vector to the data bus D. The processor also raises the RD value to high, so that it knows something is coming on D.

After the interrupt vector has been written, the interrupt handler executes on the processor, doing work while the PIC waits. After the interrupt handler finishes its work, it tells the PIC that it is done by writing certain bits to the address A and data bus D inputs. It also raises WR to high, to tell the PIC that it should be expecting a write to the data bus D. This is done via the OUT command. This is called an EOI signal, and it must be sent after the interrupt has been serviced. After this is received, the PIC removes the interrupt from the list of in-service interrupt and returns to waiting.

Now, we have a few other signals we did not consider. The RD/WR ports on the    PIC tells the PIC that the processor expects to read or write values to the PIC on the data bus. The PIC, however, is not the only device on the data bus - it has to compete with other devices as well. This is where the Address bus A and Chip Select CS must be. The address bus A is shared with all other devices, and is a 16-bit address bus usually. The chip select has to be low when the processor specifies either of 0x20 or 0x21 on the address bus. If the processor wants to talk on the PIC, it has to write 0x20 or 0x21 to the address bus in order to activate the chip select and let the PIC do something.

### Master-Slave PIC Relationship

Two (or more) PICs can be cascaded in order to provide more interrupt lines to devices. The slave PIC is usually connected on IR2, and delivers interrupts when neither of IR1 or IR0 are being reported.

One big question is which PIC should report an interrupt? The slave is also connected to the address bus (on ports 0xA0 and 0xA1) as well, so it can also send the interrupt vector as necessary. However, the slave doesn’t know if the master has an interrupt in service with a higher priority. From the master’s perspective, it knows which chip (the slave) should write the vector, but doesn’t actually know what the vector is. The solution is to send a signal from the master to the slave over the CAS bus to write to the data bus. The CAS signal is really just a 3-bit ID number to tell which slave PIC to write to the data bus. The SP signal indicates which PIC is a master and which one is a slave - if it is high, it’s a master, if it is low, it’s a slave.

### Installing an Interrupt Handler

To install an interrupt handler into the Linux environment, a call is made to request_irq to do so:

~~~
int request_irq(unsigned int irq,
                void (*handler)(int, void*, struct pt_regs*).
                unsigned long irqflags,
                const char* devname,
                void* dev_id)
~~~

Here, the irq indicates the interrupt vector we want to install to, while handler is a pointer to the interrupt handler we want to install. Irqflags is a bit vector specifying some options, devname is a string used by human-readable interfaces like /proc/interrupts, and dev_id is an arbitrary pointer holding some information about the device’s status in the kernel.

There are two flags set by the request_irq call, which are SA_SHIRQ and SA_INTERRUPT. The first allows the interrupt vector to share its handler with others, but only if all of them agree to it. The second keeps all interrupts masked on the processor through the entire handler, including ones of higher priority, so it should be used for very short executions.

If we want to execute the interrupt handler, we need to pass in three parameters: the interrupt vector, the dev_id pointer, and a pointer to a structure holding the values of the registers at the time the interrupt occurred, so we can restore them when we are done.

When a device driver calls request_irq, a new structure is allocated and filled in. This structure is passed into the irq_desc table, which is a table of interrupt descriptors. These descriptors hold a bit vector tracking the status of interrupt, a LL of interrupt handlers, a count of calls to disable the vector, and a spin lock to manage access to the descriptor.

When we have a new interrupt, we attempt to chain it to the existing LL of interrupts in that vector. If we do, it’s attached to the LL. If not, the call fails and we don’t install the driver.

To uninstall a handler, we pass the interrupt value irq and dev_id into the function free_irq, which checks the LL and removes the specified dev_id from the list. It does this cleanly and attaches any further nodes back into the list.


### Handling an interrupt in the processor

When the interrupt vector gets to the processor, several things happen:
1. On the processor, we use the interrupt vector to find the assembly linkage relating to the interrupt.
2. The assembly linkage calls do_irq.
3. Do_irq he call masks the specific interrupt on the PIC and sends an EOI for the interrupt.
4. Do_irq interacts with the corresponding interrupt controller using the jump table pointer in the descriptor. (sets a bunch of flags)
5. We call the handlers that are in the jump table pointer.
6. Handlers process stuff.
7. The handler unmasks the interrupts, indicating that the process has finished
