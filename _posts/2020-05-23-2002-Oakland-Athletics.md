Moneyball is a fantastic movie. Some of my favorite movie clips come from it. Like this one, about the A's 20-game win streak.

But one thing that it gets slightly wrong is that it ignores several players that were essential contributors to that team. It makes it sound that Scott Hatteberg, Chad Bradford, and David Justice were
the primary indicators of their success. And you can't deny that - they had essential contributions to the team. But so did the rest of the team.

|Player|Accomplishments|Age|WAR (2002)|
|Ray Durham|2x All-Star|30|1.2|
|Jermaine Dye|2x All-Star, 2005 WS MVP|28|1.4|
|Tim Hudson|4x All-Star|26|7.7|
|David Justice|3x All-Star, 1990 Rookie of the Year|36|1.6|
|Ted Lilly|2x All-Star|26|0.3|
|Mark Mulder|2x All-Star|24|4.6|
|Miguel Tejada|6x All-Star, 2002 AL MVP|28|5.7|
|Barry Zito|3x All-Star, 2002 Cy Young|24|7.1|
|Eric Chavez||24|4.3|
|Cory Lidle||30|3.5|
|Scott Hatteberg||32|3.3|
|Mark Ellis||25|2.7|

There were a lot of really impressive talent on that team, all under 30! Lots of people who were and would eventually go on to become faces of teams or All-Star players. And I can see why Beane liked Hatteberg - 3.5 WAR is nothing to sneeze at.

The Oakland Athletics were undeniably good at drafting - this season, they ended up drafting Nick Swisher, who would go on to a very good batter for the Athletics. In my opinion, and I need a lot of data to back this up, the Athletics have drafted people very well, only
to lose them in free agency when bigger teams snap them up. I guess that's why Moneyball proved to be necessary for them - it existed as a sort of arbitage for them, extracting value not seen by other teams.
