There are two causative verb forms in Arabic, form II and form IV. They generally have the same meaning, so sometimes only one from exits for a set of root letters, sometimes both form exists
with the same meaning, sometimes they have different meanings. For example,علم has both a form II and a form IV:

|Form II| Form IV |
|عَلَّمَ|أَعْلَمَ|
|To teach|To inform|

Kind of interesting how that happens. Anyways, here's the table of forms:

|Command|Verbal Noun|Present Tense|Past Tense|
|أَفْعِلْ|إِفْعالٌ|يُفْعِلُ|أَفْعَلَ|

And the doer/receiver pattern:

|Receiver|Doer|
|مُفْعَلٌ|مُفْعِلٌ|
