Half Dome is one of Yosemite's premier attractions, with only 300 permits per day allowed. These permits are obtained through
a random lottery - and it's pretty hard to get one, especially on the weekends. I had applied for a permit this year, thinking
it would be cool to climb it before I went to grad school.

Then, COVID-19 hit.

Yosemite was closed for a few months, with Half Dome permits relatively stuck in an unknown situation. Would the park open up?
Would people be able to enter and hike Half Dome? The park was closed for 3 months until things got manageable with COVID-19 in
the state. But, unfortunately, the Half Dome Cables' installation was still delayed until June 5. Also, you couldn't get into
the park without a permit, which I don't think were given out until June 5.

My Half Dome permit was for... June 5.

My friends and I essentially had the park to ourselves.

It's really eerie to essentially have an entire place to yourself. Not going to lie, it's really cool to not have any crowds, not get held back by anyone except your own self.
It's almost like we were seeing the park the way nature intended it to be seen - without people, teeming full of life and without man.

As for the hike itself, it was difficult. I don't think we really estimated how steep the climb was, and definitely how long it would take to get down. We started
relatively late, but still made it to the top before thunderstorms rolled in. Thankfully they didn't hit us, but it was a worry for a while that we were going to get
rained on.

There's a lot of switchbacks on the trail going up, and it's also relatively steep to the point where I was super tired before we even reached the cables. But it was a very scenic uphill - seeing Vernal and Nevada Falls up close without
any traffic was awesome. I also got probably the best picture I've ever taken:

![Vernal Falls](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3c_X4TIjCrjse9TAv01FaGfymT9wvDUwiMljmJrl9MReHrSij7mFaYABbdeUN1km1xtaAMB8T8Jg_q8D3cQiKHVpMeZENWgLiP7FRROH5wr1a3enS1qpj4JN-VMjOMiemHJCRjNXJJpuRYE09PhhFc=w1920-h716-no?authuser=1)

Finally, we got to the cables. And boy, were they a doozy.

![Cables](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/ACtC-3dbjgHkUiJe4eSRFOjAHlJVabEQk9bmx-CTyT2mlpcRx_fgkO7pgl75FVyJlCCBnUsAkCJ3pVmOC4N6DjrfnXHTQHl9VGO2wbmsg4PhCrhiYK5F6i-vFKrOW715IDbMxvU7ol3KsKfSy738cGD3uTxz0g=w574-h765-no?authuser=1)

The cables are basically you pushing yourself up at a 45 degree angle up a rock face. If you slip, you fall at least 100 feet. It's absolutely terrifying. Really, you have to
suspend your fear because if you even start to become scared, it's over. I would basically just not even look down, just move up as quickly as possible without trying to be afraid. Once you get to the top though, it's
an absolutely incredible view.

On the way down, we were able to catch sunset at Nevada Falls:

So, the thing is that the park is only open from 5AM - 11PM. We finished our hike at around 10PM, and barely made it out of the park (thanks to a park ranger). Hiking in the dark is scary and would not recommend.

The next day, we got to Yosemite and explored a mostly empty park. We went to Mariposa Grove, normally one of the most packed places, and found it totally empty:

We chilled in the park, slept on some benches under the trees, and relaxed in a totally empty place. All was well. You wouldn't even know there's a pandemic outside.

Finally we stopped at Tunnel View (also totally empty):

All in all, a once-in-a-lifetime trip to see a National Park with no one in it. Definitely one of the highlights of my 3 years in California, and even better to see it from the very top.
