title: Muslims in ECE&#58; A Network Study
hidden: true
---

I was having a conversation with one of my friends a couple of weeks ago after a Network Science class I was sitting in on finished, and I realized that there were a lot of people who are Muslim in the ECE department at UIUC who just don't know each other. I felt that maybe they had segmented themselves by class, and so I decided to try to model it. I'm really interested in social networks and especially visualization of social networks, so I was really intrigued by this, and wanted to see what the network really looked like, depending on who knew who.

I decided to take a crack at it. Crawling (and creeping on) Facebook pages, I built a graph of the relationships between people in ECE (who I know). This graph isn't perfect - it's very biased towards people who I know, who are mainly domestic and involved students, and not necessarily representative of the entire population.

Anyways, here's the graph:

What's interesting to see is that there are a few real "connectors" with a lot of edges connected to each other and a lot of random people who may not know a lot of people.

I'm currently in the process of adding more people and running some more statistics on how exactly each class is related.
