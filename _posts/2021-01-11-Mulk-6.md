وَلِلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ بِرَبِّهِمْ عَذَابُ جَهَنَّمَ ۖ وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ

Those who disbelieve in their Lord will suffer the punishment of Hell. What an evil destination!

# Arabic Breakdown

وَلِلَّذِينَ is made of the parts: و and الذين. الذين translates to the "those who". It's the plural of الذي and التي, which mean "He who" and "She who" respectively. They're usually used to begin sentences, and generally
take the place of the subject (from my very very very limited experience). كفروا means "to cover" normally, but in context, it means to disbelieve usually. This makes sense - when you disbelieve, you cover up the
truth in some way. Since we're talking about multiple people, the word is conjugated for third person plural past.

بِرَبِهم means "in their Lord".رب means Lord or God, and we see that very often in the Quran. It has an attached pronoun in هم, which is the plural pronoun meaning "their". Finally, we have a preposition بِ in front. Usually
this means "by/with", but in this context it can also mean "in".

عَذَابُ means punishment. We've talked about it before, but the root of it means "manners" or polite, so it's interesting how the opposite of politeness is defined. جَهَنَّمَ ۖ means Hell. I think this is actually a possessive
construct, i.e. "punishments of Hell", since جَهَنَّمَ ۖ is a definite noun.

وَبِئْسَ ٱلْمَصِيرُ is an interesting phrase. باس means misery or wretchedness, as an adjective/noun. ٱلْمَصِيرُ menas place, as we've mentioned before. Put together, this means "a wretched place."

# Commentary

StudyQuran mentions that this verse is meant to apply to those who would seek information from fortune-tellers and soothsayers. This is in reference to Ayah 5, which describe the stars as "missiles to hit Satans".
One of the bigger parts of divination was looking to interpret the stars as fortune telling, when it was not meant for that purpose. So Allah (swt) commands those to not talk to those who are fortune tellers, as they
are the ones who will suffer the punishment.
