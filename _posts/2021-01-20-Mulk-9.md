قَالُوا۟ بَلَىٰ قَدْ جَآءَنَا نَذِيرٌۭ فَكَذَّبْنَا وَقُلْنَا مَا نَزَّلَ ٱللَّهُ مِن شَىْءٍ إِنْ أَنتُمْ إِلَّا فِى ضَلَـٰلٍۢ كَبِيرٍۢ

They will reply, "Yes, a warner did come to us, but we denied and said 'Allah has revealed nothing. You are extremely astray.'"

# Arabic Breakdown

قال translates "to say", and it is a very common start to many verses in the Quran. Here, we have قالو, which is a future tense meaning "They will say". بلى means "Yes" or "affirmative".

We start a new sentence here with قد, which is a participle that affects verbs. The verb in question is جاء, which means "to come". It's in the past tense third person singular. The
participle here affects it by making it more definite, i.e. "He did come". In this case, the doer is ندير, which means warner. We also have an attached pronoun on the verb, نا, which
tells us that the sentence is "Yes, a warner did come to us."

كذب the root verb of كذَّب, and it means to lie or decieve. THe form II verb (causative) means to disbelieve or deny (to cause to lie). It's preceded by a prepositional phrase meaning "but". Next
we have وقلنا which, again, is to say, but conjugated in third person past, meaning "We said".

مانزَّل is a negation of the verb "to send down". The doer in this sentence is Allah (swt), and we have من شيء as the direct object. Usually من means from, but in this case, it means "any".
We can translate the sentence then as "Allah (swt) has not sent down anything" or "Allah (swt) has not revealed anything".

انْ is a jussive particle, but I don't think it is one in this context. I'm not entirely sure what it's purpose is here. انتم  is the pronoun for you - when we use it in a sentence, we're generally trying to say "you are".
الا means but, and ضلل  means error. كبير means great. So we can translate it as "You are but in great error".

# Commentary

According to StudyQuran, it is said that Allah (swt) will not punish those unless they have been sent a clear warner and then disbelieved.
