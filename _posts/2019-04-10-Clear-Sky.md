title: Clear Sky Charts in Python
---

I've been on a bit of an extended vacation from coding, but I decided to get back into it by creating clear sky charts. A Clear Sky Chart is essentially a table
that tells you when the best conditions for stargazing are. It takes factors like cloudiness, water vapor, and darkness into account and displays it into a nice
table for you to visualize. Usually, we can pull these from [Clear Dark Sky](http://www.cleardarksky.com/). An example dark sky chart looks like this:

Now, this is cool and all, but I figured it'd be better to do this in your terminal. Since I essentially live on my terminal, it'd be easier to just type a command
and get the sky chart right there. So I decided to rig up [PyCsk](https://pypi.org/project/pycsk/):

![PyCsk](https://warehouse-camo.cmh1.psfhosted.org/f4741ad855572017c8b8352896f9263cb3a913b2/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f44415a466c41432e706e67)

This neat little program allows you to just pull up clear sky charts in your terminal. It visualizes the data from red to green, depending on when the conditions are best.

To install:

```
$ pip3 install pycsk
```

And to run, simply type:

```
$ csk
```

It'll prompt you for your current city, and then generate one if it exists. If you want to see all the cities by state:

```
$ csk --search-by-state
```

If you want to reset your location (with the same prompts):

```
$ csk --search-by-city
```

It's still kind of a work in progress, so feel free to email me if you have any suggestions!
