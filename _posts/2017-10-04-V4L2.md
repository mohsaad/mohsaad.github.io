v4l is the video for linux library, appropriately named. Most USB webcams utilize v4l to interface with the camera at a low-level, to obtain information and to program the camera to a specific output. In this case, v4l acts like more of a driver and API, and most USB cameras are programmed to interface with v4l on Linux. It's derived from V4W (Video 4 Windows), hence where it gets its name. In this post, we will cover obtaining information from the camera, and then programming the camera to grab a frame. We'll use the ROS usb_cam driver as our example.

### Connecting to the webcam

Once you've plugged your webcam in, install the `v4l-utils` library:

```
sudo apt install v4l2-utils
```

Now you have access to the `v4l2-ctl` command, which is the command line version of what we're going to do. `v4l2-ctl` is incredibly useful - you can list and set a lot of information about the camera. First, let's get a list of our devices:

```
$ v4l2-ctl --list-devices
Lenovo EasyCamera (usb-0000:00:1d.0-1.6)
       /dev/video0
```

This tells us we have a USB webcam connected on `/dev/video0`, called `Lenovo EasyCamera`. Let's find out what we can output from it:

```
$ v4l2-ctl --list-formats-ext
```
