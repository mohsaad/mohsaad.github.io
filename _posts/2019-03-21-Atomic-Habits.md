Habits are important. I don't think anyone doubts that. I also think that a lot of people make habits and forget to follow them.
The book is primarily aimed at those who try to make habits but notoriously fail at them, myself included. 

When you first read it, everything seems... kind of obvious. For example, I pray 5 times a day most days. I didn't start by praying 5times a day, but I built myself up to it. I prayed at least once. Then I found time to do it twice, then three times, then 4, then suddenly all 5. And when I got to 5, it felt natural. And since prayer varies every day, the reward function in my brain is active and
doesn't get bored. The prayer changes by reciting different verses, surah, etc. Now I've gotten to the point where (alhamdullilah, thank you God in Arabic) if I miss a prayer, I feel legit bad and can't proceed.

Clear argues that you should build good habits and break bad ones. Generally, breaking bad habits just means to do the inverse of building a good habit. These 4 habits (in good/bad terms) are:

| Good Habit | Bad Habit |
|---|---|
| Make it Obvious | Make it Invisible |
| Make it Attractive | Make it Unattractive |
| Make it Easy | Make it Difficult |
| Make it Satisfying | Make it Unsatisfying |

Throughout the book, I started to realize that the times I was building a good habit (running, studying, public speaking) I would try to put myself in situations where the first couple rules would apply. Take running, for example. I'd do it consistently because a) it was obviously good and my enviroment calls for it b) I was competing against others and wanted to win c) I'd run close to my place so it was easy to get to and d) I'd relieve a lot of my stress by doing a 6 mile run. Interestingly enough, once a couple of these motivational factors stopped, I also stopped trying to form the habit. (I.e. after I ran a couple races and school/work was over).

Some people call it "good habits", but really, this is more a book about discipline. 
Clear does allude to that near the end, saying that sometimes, you just need to persist to keep a habit going. Almost like discipline is doing what you have to do even if it's inconvenient or hard. Sounds a little like religion, right?

I also felt a lot of the habits ended up coming down to one thing: controlling your environment. If your environment follows the four things above (in some capacity) then habit building is actually not too bad. If you hang out in an environment of runners, you'll end up being a runner. One thing that does concern me about this statement is that sometimes you need to break away from your environment to build better habits.
It's probably not conducive to your running if all your friends just sit around and drink tea while crapping on your enthusiasm for running. (Maybe you need better friends, too.)
I'm definitely oversimplifying it quite a bit, but at least for me, controlling your environment can lead to a lot of good results.
