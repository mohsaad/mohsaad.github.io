title: Arabic Form V verbs
description: The reflexive verb form

The form V verb is the reflexive form, and it means a verb that is done to itself. It's a weird verb form, doesn't make a whole ton of sense. Some examples
of this include the verb تفتح which means "to open up". Essentially you take the verb and use it on itself, which is a weird way to think about it.

Anyways, here's the conjugations:

|Command|Verbal Noun|Present Tense|Past Tense|
|تَفَعَّلْ|تَفَعَّلٌ|يَتَفَعَّلُ|تَفَعَّلَ|

|Reciever|Doer
|مُتُفَعِّلٌ|مُتَفَعَّلٌ|
