title: Reflections on 3 years of living in the Bay Area
description: Some personal thoughts upon moving out.
tags: ['personal']
---

Earlier this week, I moved out of the Bay Area to go to the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor for graduate school.
While driving, I thought about all the things I've learned and experienced and tried to grow from there. And there's
a lot. I don't think it's quite hit me yet, but there's a lot of things that I really enjoyed about the place, despite
it's shortcomings. People really hate the Bay Area because it's expensive and spread out, and that it can be hard to
find a real community that isn't just work. I think I found that, and that's why I look back on it positively.

Looking back at my first experience living in San Francisco, I was this weird, awkward 21 year old kid who didn't really know what to
do with his life. I'd never really lived outside of Illinois except for 2 internships. So I guess I wasn't totally unprepared. I didn't really
know anyone in SF, and as someone who had more or less become more religous over college, it was hard to find a community of people who were my
age at the masjid. (S/o to the Crescent Street masjid, though - that place was always kind to me, and I often would try to catch Fajr/Isha there
if possible.) I had come during Ramadan and almost immediately went back for the rest of Ramadan, which meant missing a lot of the community events
that popped up during then. In hindsight, that was probably not great - I knew a few people who had moved out at the same time who also didn't
know anyone and spent that first year lonely.

My first few days I spent meeting my new team and getting to know them a little bit. I had no idea how to take public transit, so I ended up walking
everywhere. This was a bad idea, as I ended up scaling some pretty large hills to get back to my apartment.

I had joined Iris Automation, and had never heard of them. Apparently they had liked my experience with ROS and C++, so they hired me
as one of their software engineers. I'm still really thankful to Alexander Harmsen, James Howard, and Somik Ghosh for giving me that
opportunity - in classic Saad fashion, I was indecisive about it until the last moment, at which point I decided to go for it. But it gave me
a fresh start, and a chance to really explore some opportunities and hobbies that I never thought I'd have. I learned a ton while being there,
like how to structure software projects, a lot about interacting with users and listening to feedback, and structuring projects for success.

As a graduation gift, I had gotten a Sony A6000 camera to learn photography and try and pick up a hobby so I wouldn't talk about papers and
coding all the time. I found that I really enjoyed photography, taking a couple of fairly cool pictures that were much better than my
phone at the time. In particular, at a company retreat, some employees at Iris showed me how to take night pictures, and especially pictures of the
Milky Way. I thought this was the coolest thing ever, and I haven't lost any interest in astrophotography ever since.

However, for all my new hobbies, my life was still majority work and... more work. While I tried to explore SF on the weekends, it was lonely being
by myself and not having discussion partners for the ideas swimming around in my head. I had tried to keep a healthy work-life divide, but it
increasingly looked like I'd just move back to Illinois for grad school, a prospect I was slowly resigning myself to. Something changed that March
of 2018 though - I made friends!

Well, I guess I didn't make friends until really during/after Ramadan. But nonetheless, I decided to take the chance and not return to grad school
right away. It ended up being a great decision - with people, I felt like I wasn't spending a whole lot of time by myself anymore, and I was going
on trips to really cool places. For example, I went to Arches National Park:

I got really good at taking Milky Way pictures:

I got really into cycling:

I had switched jobs at this point to the Toyota Research Institute, which was... hard. I was by far the youngest on the team, and didn't really
find a place until I found a subtopic that I could put a lot of effort into without screwing up everything else. With that, I was able to overcome
my imposter syndrome and really find a position that I grew a lot in. I finally was able to balance my personal and work life a lot better at this
point, with some tradeoffs between the two.

Also, working for a Japanese company meant I got to go to Japan and run a relay race. That was cool.

I had also left San Francisco at this point, to go live in San Mateo, CA. San Mateo is a suburb, and it's super quiet. This meant I couldn't
hang out with my city friends as much, which bummed me out, but I got to know a lot of people down in South Bay.

My new roommate was also a great guy, and really exposed me to a lot of the religion that I hadn't known, such as how to read the Quran properly, and
becoming interested in what it really means. I guess you could have called me a passive Muslim before that, someone going through the motions and
not understanding anything. I learned a lot from my roommate and the people in South Bay, and I'm really thankful for all of them.

lessons because of my roommate, and really benefited from them." %}

As 2020 approached, I realized my foot wasn't in a great place, and I decided to have surgery to correct some issues with them. This led me to spend
most of late 2019 and early 2020 back at home. Then coronavirus happened, and I was forced to stay at home even longer due to a second follow-up
surgery.

It's kind of crappy that my time in the Bay Area ended like this, but I'm glad for all the people I've met and who helped me grow, and
become more outgoing and lively. From a very awkward and shy kid, I know I've become more social and active, and learned a ton from those around me.
I know that I've disappointed some people, and for them I ask for your forgiveness. InshaAllah (if God wills) we'll meet again after graduate school.
