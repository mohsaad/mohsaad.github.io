Last semester, I sat in for a couple of weeks on a class called [Network Science: Dynamics and Flow](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece498lv3/sp2017/)
taught by [Lav R. Varshney](http://varshney.web.engr.illinois.edu).
I've always been interested in networks, and how information spreads between places. It's also neat to see random
connections appear between places, in ways that you may not expect.

This brings me to David Mitchell's books, especially _Ghostwritten_, his first novel. Mitchell's style is
to weave connections between chapters in such a way that is sometimes obvious, sometimes very subtle. It's a style
which I really enjoy, and he's done it both here and in _Cloud Atlas_ and _number9dream_.

_Ghostwritten_'s subtitle is "A Novel in Nine Parts", as it tells a nine different stories from a terrorist in Japan to
a noncorporeal spirit in Mongolia to a late-night radio host in New York. All the tales are related in some way shape or form,
but it's not obvious right away. I thought it would be really neat to map out all the connections, and although it's not very
useful, it's a cool data visualization.

Here's a basic plot in NetworkX:

There's still some connections I'm reading up on and when I finish the book the map will hopefully be more complete!
In addition, I really want to add descriptions and make it interactive, but hey, it's a start.
