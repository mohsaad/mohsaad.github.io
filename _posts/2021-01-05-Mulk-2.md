ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلْمَوْتَ وَٱلْحَيَوٰةَ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًۭا ۚ وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْغَفُورُ

˹He is the One˺ Who created death and life in order to test which of you is best in deeds. And He is the Almighty, All-Forgiving.

# Arabic Breakdown

ٱلَّذِى translates to "The one who". I presume the "He is" is added for English speakers to make it a full sentence.

خَلَقَ ٱلْمَوْتَ وَٱلْحَيَوٰةَ is a verbal sentence, with خَلَقَ as our form I verb meaning "to create". الخليق is also a name of Allah (swt), meaning
"The Creator". The word itself is very common in the Quran, as Allah (swt) often describes him as one who creates. The doer here is implied
to be Allah (swt).

ٱلْمَوْتَ translates death or demise. Interestingly, the root verb here is مات, which is to die. Not sure why there's a difference here besides
possibly different noun forms. ٱلْحَيَوٰةَ translates to life. I couldn't find the root verb here, so please message me if you know what it is!

Putting it all together, we have "Who created death and life."

Next we have لِيَبْلُوَكُمْأَيُّكُمْ. This is interesting, because we have 2 possible meanings. The verb here is بلو, which is a form I verb meaning to test.
We have an attached pronoun in كم, which means "you all". The reason it has 4 possible meanings is because of the لِ in front, which can mean:

* let, should
* in order to

The difference happens in case. Let/should is only in the مجزوم (or jussive) case. Since we're in the منصوب case (our last letter has a fatha on it), our meaning is "in order to".
أَيُّ translates to "which", so we can translate this phrase to be "in order to test which of you all". The translation above omits the "all" for brevity.

أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًۭا ۚ is our final part of the sentence. أَحْسَنُ is the comparative version of حسن, which means to be good. In a sense, this means "better". عَمَلًۭا ۚ
translates deeds, and comes from the root verb ُعَمَلَ, which means to do, or to work.

Putting it all together, we have:

"Who created death and life in order to test which of you is bet in deeds."

The last part of the ayat is:

وَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلْغَفُورُ

This is a nominal sentence, with the خبر being the two names of Allah (swt), ٱلْعَزِيزُ and ٱلْغَفُورُ, meaning the most Mightly, and the most Forgiving.

# Commentary

It's really interesting how death comes before life in the Ayah. StudyQuran mentions that Allah (swt) has created death for humans in relation to this world, for
_every soul shall taste death_ (21:35) and life in relation to the hereafter. This means that death is the ultimate end of this world, while another one awaits full
of eternal life.

StudyQuran also mentions that this verse is about trials. Trials are a part of being Muslim, and StudyQuran mentions that they are an aspect of Allah (swt)'s mercy,
as they're an integral part of the process of purification. One interesting hadith comes to mind: "If God wants to do good to somebody, He affects him with trials." (Bukhari).
This is interesting because trials present us with an opportunity to do better. I don't think I ever really realized this, but looking back at some of the more difficult
periods in my life, I'm oddly thankful for them, as they expiated or removed insecurities or doubts about my faith, and ultimately led me to become a better Muslim. And it's
even evident in the Ayah - Allah(swt) tests us to see which of us is best in deeds.

One last note from StudyQuran is that the Prophet (SAW) stopped after reading ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ ٱلْمَوْتَ وَٱلْحَيَوٰةَ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًۭا ۚ, and said "The most wary of what God has
forbidden and the quickest to obey God." (Muslim)

One reflection I found on QuranReflect is that Allah (swt) mentions those in the _best_ of deeds, not the _most_ of deeds. It's not the quantity that matters - but the
quality of them. I think that's something I need to improve on as well sometimes. This is meant to be encouragement - to not get let down by the amount that we may have,
but to be encourage us to be the best (Ihsan) of what we can do.
