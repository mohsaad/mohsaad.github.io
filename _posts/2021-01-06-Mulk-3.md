ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَـٰوَٰتٍۢ طِبَاقًۭا ۖ مَّا تَرَىٰ فِى خَلْقِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ مِن تَفَـٰوُتٍۢ ۖ فَٱرْجِعِ ٱلْبَصَرَ هَلْ تَرَىٰ مِن فُطُورٍۢ

˹He is the One˺ Who created seven heavens, one above the other. You will never see any imperfection in the creation of the Most Compassionate. So look again: do you see any flaws?

# Arabic Breakdown

Similarly to Ayah 2, we start with ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ, which means "The one who created".

Next we have سَبْعَ سَمَـٰوَٰتٍۢ. سَبْعَ translates seven, and  سَمَـٰوَٰتٍۢ translates to skies and heavens. I think this is a possessive construct, as evidenced by the tanween kasra on
سَمَـٰوَٰتٍۢ, but possesive constructs are usually definite, so I'm not entirely sure. Either way, it refers to the seven heavens above us that Allah (swt) has constructed.

طِبَاقًۭا is interesting. The root word is طبق, which normally means to cover (form II). However, this version of the word actually means "one on top of the other". This is in
relation to the heavens mentioned previously, being on top of each other.

The next part of the ayah starts with a negation in  مَّا. This negation is used as the verb تَرَىٰ (you see) is in present tense, so you could say it as "You do not see".
The base verb for تَرَىٰ is راي, which is to see. It's conjugated in the second present tense, or "you ___".

The direct object of that sentence is فِى خَلْقِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ .    فِى translates in, while خَلْقِ ٱلرَّحْمَـٰنِ is a possessive construct meaning "the creation of the Merciful." The entire
phrase is مجرور since we have a prepositional phase, and then a possessive construct right after.

مِن تَفَـٰوُات   is the next phrase.  مِن can have many meanings, but in this context, it means "any". تَفَـٰوُت has the root letters فوت, which has the meaning to pass away, or to fail. In
this case, however, it means fault. The entire sentence becomes "You will not see in the Merciful's Creation any fault."

Finally, we have the last part of the ayah, which is فَٱرْجِعِ ٱلْبَصَرَ هَلْ تَرَىٰ مِن فُطُورٍۢ.

فَٱرْجِعِ starts off with a ف in front, meaning "so". The actual verb is أرجع, which is a form IV verb meaning "to make return". The direct object of this
sentence is ٱلْبَصَرَ, which means eyesight or vision. Putting it together, we see that this means "So return your sight".

The last part of this phrase is هَلْ تَرَىٰ مِن فُطُورٍۢ,. هل in this case is "Can" and is a preposition. We have the word تَرَىٰ after, again meaning "you see" in the present tense.
Finally, we have مِن فُطُورٍۢ, where مِن means "any" once again.  فُطُورٍۢ has the root letters فطر, which means to create out of nothing. But  فُطُورٍۢ means "flaw" - I'm very curious why,
but I don't have a good answer for that now.

Putting it all together, we find that the last sentence ends up being "So return your sight; can you see any flaw?"

# Commentary

StudyQuran mentions that the heavens are designed to be perfect.  تَفَـٰوُت can also mean disproportion, and so it can be said that the heavens are not disconnected.
The idea that Allah (swt) commands us to look at something twice is also interesting - it's almost a challenge to those to try and find any imperfection. We are commanded to
look, and often we see imperfections in our own creations (just look at how many bugs I code up) - but we cannot find issue in the skies or the earth. It's one of Allah (swt)'s,
The Creator's, blessings upon us.
