فَٱعْتَرَفُوا۟ بِذَنۢبِهِمْ فَسُحْقًۭا لِّأَصْحَـٰبِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ

And so they will confess their sins. So away with the residents of the Blaze!

# Arabic Translation

ف translates to "so" or "then". In this case, I think it means "so". اعترف is the form VIII verb of عرف, which means "to know". That makes the form VIII
verb "to confess", or like the passive version.
