Recently while doing some spring cleaning while being stuck at home, I came across a letter from my 7th grade self. It's kind of amusing reading it to myself 12 years later, when the world is so
different (and under lockdown). It's also interesting to think about how much of myself has changed, and what my priorities were as a middle schooler vs now.

Here it is.

Dear Future Myself,
  I have to do one of these "write to you in the future" kinds of assignments, unfortunately. This time, it's for Language Arts. So, my future self in about six months, how are you doing?
Where are you? Do you still play video games? Do you still like to read every free second you have? Have any new scientific things been discovered that change the way we live? If so, what
are they?</i>

<i>
  Well, I might as well describe myself as of January 15th, 2008. I'm honest, obedient to my parents, and take French classes. In my possessions I have a Wii gaming console, some Legos, a
desk, and a room. Several traits of mine are that I hate milk, love reading, and absolutely hate writing. I like to play video games, swim in a pool, taking the bus home, and reading
Anthony Horowitz's books. I also like to eat fast food and homemade food both.

There are also some things that I hate, like milk and dancing, that I will not list. Well, I'm afraid that I must end here. Hopefully the future will be better!

Sincerely,
Present Day Mohammad Saad (as of January 15, 2008)

Some thoughts:
* "Hopefully the future will be better" HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA
* I think I really disliked writing and really wanted to do math and science, and so my writing really suffered. I do wish I had been more thoughtful about it.
* Nothing has changed re: the milk part. Also still not a great dancer.
* I probably had an ego, or was super childish.
* There's been lots of scientific discoveries! Higgs Boson, deep neural nets, black holes, and more!
* I'm not a possessions kind of guy, and it really shows - although my Bionicles are really important to me!
* Interestingly I still like to read, but unfortunately don't have much time for it anymore. :( My types of reading has definitely shifted from fiction to non-fiction
however. Turns out reality really is stranger than fiction!
