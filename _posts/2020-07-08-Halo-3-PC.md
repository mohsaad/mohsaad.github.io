For context, I was a big Halo 2 for PC player back in the day. We couldn't afford an Xbox 360 or Xbox Live, so I had to make do with Halo 2 for the PC. I remember playing many days on the MonstrMoose / i4Ni / SmG clan servers,
all the random drama that popped up when playing the game, fighrs over bans, clan splits, hackers, and so on.

Back then, we all were jumping on every tidbit of Halo 3 news. We'd call technical support and ask if H3PC was coming. We'd annoy 343 and Bungie on the forums. No one cared about the H2V community, of course - the playerbase
was tiny and no one wanted to deal with the headache of problems that came with it. It was, for once, the wild wild west.

I think a Halo 3 PC committee would have been the most exciting thing, as it would have been a beath of fresh air for 14-15 year old me.

But eventually, school started up, I started to play other games, and my involvement in the H2V community dropped. Like everyone else's. I grew up.

Now, this news comes out 10 years later. I finished high school, college, got a job.

And all I can say to this now is, "eh".
