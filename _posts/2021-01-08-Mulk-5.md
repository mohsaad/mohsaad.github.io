وَلَقَدْ زَيَّنَّا ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا بِمَصَـٰبِيحَ وَجَعَلْنَـٰهَا رُجُومًۭا لِّلشَّيَـٰطِينِ ۖ وَأَعْتَدْنَا لَهُمْ عَذَابَ ٱلسَّعِيرِ

"And indeed, We adorned the lowest heaven with ˹stars like˺ lamps, and made them ˹as missiles˺ for stoning ˹eavesdropping˺ devils, for whom We have also prepared the torment of the Blaze."

# Arabic Breakdown

ولقد translates to "And certainly". I wasn't able to find this in Hans Wehr, but it was the accepted translation on Quran.com and Quranhive.com suggest that it is, so I'll go with it.
زيَّنَّا is a form II verb, menaing "to decorate, to cause to be beautiful". The root word, زين, is a pretty common girl's name, meaning beauty. I was confused about
the shadda on the letters, but apparently this word is conjugated for the first person plural past, which has an ending of نا. This causes the shadda on the ن, and explains
why there's an alif right after.

The direct object of the sentence is ٱلسَّمَآءَ ٱلدُّنْيَا. This is an adjectival phrase, meaning that ٱلدُّنْيَا describes ٱلسَّمَآءَ. ٱلدُّنْيَا means "lower" while ٱلسَّمَآءَ means skies or heavens.
What Allah (swt) is trying to say here is "We created the lower heavens". Allah (swt) follows that up with بِمَصَـٰبِيحَ., مصبيح translates to "lamps" with the preposition "with" in front.
I'm not entirely sure why the word isn't مجرور, since this should be a prepositional phrase. I'll have to figure that out.

We start a new sentence with وَجَعَلْنَـٰهَا, which is a form I verb meaning "to make". It has an attached pronoun of ها, which is the plural attached pronoun meaning "them". رجوم translates
"to stone", and is the verbal noun.  لِّلشَّيَـٰطِينِ ۖ  translates "for the devils". Writing this sentence out, we have: "We adorned the lowest heavens with lamps, and made them for stoning devils."

وَأَعْتَدْنَا is a form IV verb, meaning "to prepare". It's in the first person plural past, meaning "We prepared." لَهُمْ means "for them". عَذَابَ is interesting, since the root words عَذَبَ usually means
polite, or agreeable. But عَذَابَ actually means torment - the total opposite! ٱلسَّعِيرِ translates to the Blaze, and this is part of a possessive construct - i.e. the full version is
"torment of the Blaze".

# Commentary

The lamps mentioned are also seen as starts, for both decoration, but also for expelling the devils. StudyQuran mentions an interesting commentary by Qatadah, "The creation of the stars is for
three things: decoration of the nearest heaven, missiles to hit the satans, and signs to guide travelers.". StudyQuran also mentions that the functions of meteors or shooting stars is to bar the satans
from listening to the secrets of Heaven, to which they had previously enjoyed access - as referenced in several other Surahs. (15:16-18, 37:6-10, 72:8-9). As someone who often takes pictures of the stars,
and looks up to them almost every night, I never realized that purpose behind them - for me, they were always decorations of the heavens. But everything has a purpose, and sometimes the purpose isn't obvious.
We should be mindful of those purposes, and make sure that we respect and understand everything's purpose.
