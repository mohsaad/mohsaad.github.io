This was a hackathon project done for HackIllinois 2015. We decided to create an app to look for free parking spaces. Usually, this is either handled on an open basis - there's no real way to automate this. I guess you could put sensors in each parking spot, but that's expensive and maybe not very practical. So we decided to handle this another way - by using computer vision.

We aligned a camera over a bunch of parking spaces, and looked for cars in each of the parking spaces. This camera does need to be calibrated - you need to manually place dots at each of the corners of the parking spot. While this is annoying, you should be able to do it just once without an issue. A better algorithm (that I would have done if we had more time - 36 hours isn't a lot) would have been to utilize some form of learning algorithm, doing edge detection and then pass those features into an SVM.

Instead of looking for a car in a spot, we decided to look for empty parking spts. To do this, after getting the four corners of the parking spot, we perform a 4-point perspective transform [1] to get the image of the parking spot. We also store a reference image of an empty parking spot, and then perform a cross-correlation of the histogram of both images. Afterwards, we threshold the value to determine if the spot is empty or not. Obviously this has a lot of variance, but the general algorithm is pretty robust against noise.

We also designed iOS and Pebble apps to tell people where parking spots were, and to record when and how much you were going to pay.

In the end, we won two awards: The GE Best use of Image Recognition award, and the Thiel Prize for Business Potential.
