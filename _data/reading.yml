      - title: Halo&#58; The Flood
        author: William Dietz
        link: https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Flood-William-C-Dietz/dp/0765367300
        review: This book is essentially a retelling of the first game in the series, and in my opinion doesn't really add anything new. While it is interesting to see what happened
                witb the rest of the crew on the Pillar of Autumn, the book essentially tries to re-tell the game in a different manner that isn't as enjoyable as just playing the game.
                There's also no real extra information about the world or why the people are doing what they're doing, although the Covenant bits are probably the closest we can get to that.
                All in all, I wouldn't recommend to read unless you're a really big fan of the Halo Universe.
      - title: Halo&#58; First Strike
        author: Eric Nylund
        link: https://www.amazon.com/Halo-First-Strike-Eric-Nylund/dp/0765367319
        review: People say that Halo is easy science fiction, and at first I wanted to disagree with them. But after re-reading this book, I can see it. It's very focused on the military
                tactics of the time beween the first two games, and not enough on world building. There's a lot of unexplained things that go missed, like what exactly the Forerunner crystal
                does / is important. The entire Unyielding Heirophant section should have been longer and more detailed, rather than a few chapters. I think the book constantly leaves you hanging
                on the edge of the seat, which is fun the first time you read it, but not really any other times.
      - title: Means of Ascent
        author: Robert A. Caro
        star: yes
        link: https://amzn.to/2KCyjec
        review: This work chronicles the years of Lyndon Johnson in between losing his first Senate race in 1941 and winning in 1948. Set against the backdrop of WWII,
                it's an interesting example of how politicians who can successfully cultivate influence among the government and also pay off local politicians can attain
                great power and wealth. Caro doesn't like Johnson, but there's almost a begurdging respect for his schemes. He also seems to idolize Coke Stevenson, the former governer,
                quite a bit. Overall, though, a fantastic book about how to cultivate influence and really become political.
