        review: A book based on virtual reality tech that doesn't exist yet, with a plot that feels somewhat relevant. This is a strange book - it's a deep dive into MMORPGs and a
                futuristic virtual world, and all the weirdness of internet culture that comes out of it. Interweaved into it is an actual plot about identity and how easy it is
                to misrepresent on the internet. We all live as avatars in the real world, and sometimes its easy to hide that aspect of ourselves. The plot sags in the middle (too
                much intimate details that are really not needed) but the ending is interestng enough for a read.

        review: What a read! Life of Pi is super interesting because it's a book that's both great on the superficial level, but also has plenty of details you can dive into and reflect on. I think the main
                part of the book that I really enjoyed was his phases of life - he's on the raft, but the raft molds him into something he's not - a tiger to survive. And when he's off, the tiger
                persona leaves him as well, as it's not needed. Add into it is Pi's search for religion, and what it really represents in our lives and the world around us, and it's a book to think about for a
                long time.

      - title: The Death of Ivan Ilyich
        author: Leo Tolstoy
        star: yes
        link: https://www.amazon.com/Death-Ivan-Ilyich-Bantam-Classics/dp/0553210351
        review: I'm not sure if you can even call this a book, as it's only something like 30 pages of exposition. But I found it very impactful. I think what spoke to me most was this idea that
                nothing matters when you die. As muslims, we know this - it's instilled in us from a young age to not regard these things as permanent, and that God can take them away at any point. But I think
                seeing Ivan Ilyich's life grow and him relegate himself to these material successes that didn't mean anything speaks to me. It's the idea of drowning yourself in fake promotions and fake success
                because the real world is terrifying and scary, and finding a place in the working world, while easier in the short term, but comes at a cost to your moral and personal life.
      - title: Deep Work
        author: Cal Newport
        star: yes
        link: https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Cal-Newport-audiobook/dp/B0189PVAWY/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3QFRFT8HXXEFK&dchild=1&keywords=deep+work+cal+newport&qid=1606172993&sprefix=deep+work+cal+n%2Caps%2C182&sr=8-1
        review: Deep Work is about how to execute and do focused, hard work. The idea here is that you can accomplish more in a few hours of deep, undistracted focused work than a lots of hours of what he calls
                "shallow" work, which is things like checking email, responding to messages, or doing very surface level things. I really appreciated the books approach in how to strucutre your time, whether that's
                with the Palmodoro method (25min on, 5min off) or by literally scheduling every single part of your day. It's not really interesting to read about, though, and it's fairly short - I put it down for
                two months and didn't pick it back up, even if it was ultimatly something I wanted to do.
      - title: The Path to Power
        author: Robert A. Caro
        star: yes
        link: https://www.amazon.com/Path-Power-Years-Lyndon-Johnson/dp/0679729453
        review: I've been really curious recently about why Lyndon Johnson, a person from the South, came to become the formidable Democrat he was during the 1960s. Caro's work is definitive, and you can tell why.
                Every chapter is told in excruciating detail, how Johnson weaved a path to power through his youth and college years, to brown-nosing important men when he wanted to get ahead,
                by forging alliances when it was not needed, and being ultimately pragmatic in his approach to power. It almost reads as a political guide to how to attain power, and especially
                with money in today's politics, his approaches seem so familiar. 100% worth a read if you're interested in how people attain and wield power, even in today's modern times.
      - title: Halo&#58; The Flood
        author: William Dietz
        link: https://www.amazon.com/Halo-Flood-William-C-Dietz/dp/0765367300
        review: This book is essentially a retelling of the first game in the series, and in my opinion doesn't really add anything new. While it is interesting to see what happened
                with the rest of the crew on the Pillar of Autumn, the book essentially tries to re-tell the game in a different manner that isn't as enjoyable as just playing the game.
                There's also no real extra information about the world or why the people are doing what they're doing, although the Covenant bits are probably the closest we can get to that.
                All in all, I wouldn't recommend to read unless you're a really big fan of the Halo Universe.
      - title: Halo Fractures&#58; Extraordinary Tales from the Halo Canon
        author: Various Authors
        link: https://www.amazon.com/HALO-Fractures-Extraordinary-Tales-Canon/dp/1501140671
        star: yes
        review: I actually really like this collection of short stories in the Halo Universe. There's a lot of interesting stories that reveal attitudes after the Human-Covenant War, especially
                among the colonists who are trying to resettle after it all went down. Kind of interesting to see how the Sangelli and humans get along (which is, to say, not well). Plus it has the
                epilogue of Bornstellar Meets Eternal Lasting, which is a nice closure to his story.
      - title: Halo&#58; First Strike
        author: Eric Nylund
        link: https://www.amazon.com/Halo-First-Strike-Eric-Nylund/dp/0765367319
        review: People say that Halo is easy science fiction, and at first I wanted to disagree with them. But after re-reading this book, I can see it. It's very focused on the military
                tactics of the time beween the first two games, and not enough on world building. There's a lot of unexplained things that go missed, like what exactly the Forerunner crystal
                does / is important. The entire Unyielding Heirophant section should have been longer and more detailed, rather than a few chapters. I think the book constantly leaves you hanging
                on the edge of the seat, which is fun the first time you read it, but not really any other times.
      - title: Means of Ascent
        author: Robert A. Caro
        star: yes
        link: https://amzn.to/2KCyjec
        review: This work chronicles the years of Lyndon Johnson in between losing his first Senate race in 1941 and winning in 1948. Set against the backdrop of WWII,
                it's an interesting example of how politicians who can successfully cultivate influence among the government and also pay off local politicians can attain
                great power and wealth. Caro doesn't like Johnson, but there's almost a begurdging respect for his schemes. He also seems to idolize Coke Stevenson, the former governer,
                quite a bit. Overall, though, a fantastic book about how to cultivate influence and really become political.
