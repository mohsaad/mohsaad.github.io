Here's a running list of prepositions I've come across.

One interesting thing is that any word that comes after a preposition will automatically be in the جَرْ (genitive) case. These prepositions are called حّرْفُ الحَرِّ, while the noun
that follows is called an اِسْمُ مَحْرُورِاِ. As a while, this is called a preposition phrase.


| Translation| Arabic |
| About,from |       |
| in |    |
| like | |
| for, to have |     |
| with, by     |     |
| upon      |       |
| to        |
