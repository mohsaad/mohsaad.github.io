While taking a star trail picture at [Shark Fin Cove](https://santacruzlife.com/shark-fin-cove/) I came across a suprisingly well-maintained railroad.

This railroad belonged to the Southern Pacific Railroad, who established the line in 1905 as a connection between Davenport and Santa Cruz. Davenport was the site of a cement plant that connected the logging town of Swanton with the city of Santa Cruz.
It was the Southern Pacific's answer to the Ocean Shore's ambitions to build a railroad between San Francisco and Santa Cruz. It never really got off the ground, though, and the Davenport line was the only one built.
The railroad was originally both a freight and a passenger line. Passenger service was never great, though - it mostly served workers at the logging plant and the cement plant, and was used as a flag stop (i.e. you have to tell the conductor to stop) after 1911. Passenger service was ended in 1920, and it became another freight line for a while. 
The cement plant (and the railroad) was used until 2005, until it was closed down for mercury reasons. Rail service was pretty much abandoned even after the tracks were cleared in 2011.

Now, the future is uncertain for the cement plant (and the tracks). There's a [plan](http://www.co.santa-cruz.ca.us/Portals/0/Cemex/Coastal_Reuse_Plan_22619.pdf) being proposed for reusing the plant area and turning it into a jobs center or an environmental area. Until then, it's just a vestige of a car-less era.
