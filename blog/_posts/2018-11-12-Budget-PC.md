title: Building a "Budget" PC
tags: [tutorials]
---

I've been working on building a new PC for a while now, and finally got the funds and time to actually build it. I'm intending to use this for mainly deep learning and computer vision research, as well as a bit of GPU programming. So therefore, I needed two things:

1. A lot of GPU power
2. A lot of possibility for storage expansion

For the rest, I didn't want to totally skimp out on the components, as your performance can take a hit if you have a terrible CPU or hard drive. So, I tried to optimize for price vs performance as much as possible.

Here's the part list:

A couple notes:

1) A Titan XP!?!?

Yeah, I got it used from a friend who had won it in a raffle and didn't use it for any bitcoin mining or anything. It ended up being quite a steal!

2) I decided to go for an AMD Ryzen processor because Intel's processors are notoriously expensive for the performance they give you. A six-core CPU with plenty of overclocking potential is more than enough for the stuff I'm going to be running.

3) I do need to get more storage. After running my system for a week, 120 GB for a primary partition is terrible. I'm probably going to get a 500GB SSD (which is somehow only 90$?!) and use that instead. It'll give me more space to install programs.

4) I'm using Ubuntu, though I may later get a Windows license for playing some games. (Doubtful, considering I don't play games anymore)

5) Need more RAM! 32 GB should be more than enough for my needs.

6) I'm not super worried about cooling, but I think I'll need a couple more fans just in case. It helps that the place I live in is pretty cold (because I don't like turning on the heat).

Anyways, there's my new PC build. I'll be using this to set up a lot of robotics and vision problems. Look out soon!
