title: Anomaly Detection using Computer Vision

### Members: Greg Linkowski and Mohammad Saad

Anomaly detectors are fairly common in the machine vision realm, as they are used to inspect parts for defects. They are much more common in the manufacturing world than in the computer vision realm.

However, a few weeks into the second semester, Greg found an article in the Washington Post about "predictors" of crime. The idea is that suspicous activities often predate crime, such as standing around in not-normally trafficked places, suddenly breaking out into a run, etc. With video surveillance, what if you could detect when people are committing suspicous activity leading up to a crime?

We focused our attention on mostly trying to detect human-based crime, not anything with cars or of the like. We utilized Histogram of Oriented Gradient Detectors [1] which are pre-trained human detectors that are freely available in the OpenCV library. This allowed us to quickly test in real-time our system, as the sliding windows are very close to real time.
