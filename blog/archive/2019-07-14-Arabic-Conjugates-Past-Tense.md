In my Fawakih course I've been studying Arabic conjugates. The Arabic conjugates are pretty confusing, so I figured I could put together a table for review. I'll start with the past tense words. The base word itself is دَرَسَ, or "to study". 
### Past Tense

#### First Person

|Arabic Singular|English Singular|Arabic Plural|English Plural|
|:-:|---|---|---|
|دَرَسْتُ   |I studied|دَرَسْنَا   |We studied|

#### Second Person

|Arabic Singular|English Singular|Arabic Plural|English Plural|
|:-:|---|---|---|
|دَرَسْتَ   |You (m) studied|دَرَسْتٌما   |You (2,m) studied|
|   |   |دَرَسْتُم   |You (3+,m) studied|
|دَرَسْتِ   |You (f) studied|دَرَسْتُنَّ |You (3+,f) studied|

#### Third Person

|Arabic Singular|English Singular|Arabic Plural|English Plural|
|:-:|---|---|---|
|دَرَسَ |He studied | دَرَسَا  |They (2,m) studied|
|   |   | دَرَسُوا  |They (3+,m) studied|
|دَرَسَتْ   |She studied|رَرَسَتَا   | They (2,f) studied|
|   |   |دَرَسْنَ   |They (3+,f) studied|
