Becuase of COVID-19, I'm suddenly the leader for Taraweeh prayers. Taraweeh is an optional prayer at night that usually goes for about an hour or two every night during the holy month of Ramadan. Since I only know surahs from the last "book" of the Quran, I made a spreadsheet (with some help from my friend Adil) helping me to plan out my prayers every night, and tell me what I should review before going in. It also has some nice functionalities like counting how many surash you've read, days of the month, etc.

Here's the spreadsheet. \[[Link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nBvZrnV-H602R90_5F4UL50fRVlpBA0p-PuXF0aE39w/edit?usp=sharing)\]
