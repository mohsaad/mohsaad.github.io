I ran the Oakland Sprint Duathlon this morning, and it was hard. I didn't train all too much,
so that's definitely something to improve on. Despite that, I still managed to place 8th out of 40,
which isn't bad for my first one. I guess here's some future advice to myself:

## Train for the transition

The transition from biking to run is difficult, mostly because biking and running use very different
muscles. So when I transitioned from the bike to run, my muscles all cramped and I couldn't run for a solid mile,
which killed my run time. I think making sure that you've streched and ready for a 5k/10k is probably more important
than minimizing your transition time.

## Eating and drinking while biking

I didn't have a water bottle or any food goo on my bike ride, which turned out to be a mistake. After the bike ride (~40
minutes of straight pedaling) you're tired and very low on energy. To run after that requires some refreshments, either in
the form of Gatorade or food goo. Doing that on the bike ride would have helped me a lot.

## The bike type doesn't matter (mostly)

I saw a lot of people on triathlon bikes passing me, but I noticed that my own speed depended on how consistently I pedaled.
When I pedaled consistently, I would usually be hitting 17-18mph, whereas the people faster would be going only a little faster (20-25mph).
Since I took a few breaks or rested on my pedals a few times, I think that slows you down more than anything else. It also helped
that I finally learned how to get up and pedal, instead of always sitting down. That really helps especially when you're trying to speed
up to pass someone.

I'm looking forward to the next one (probably a triathlon) in Monterey in October!
