One of my favorite songs in "Shelter" by Porter Robinson & Madeon:

So I sometimes read the comments of videos I like, just to see what people generally think of a specific song, or to see any original jokes (usually there are none).
But interestingly there's something going on - a lot of people posting their own diaries. This is because of one user, JustJeff, who has posted a comment on this video
every day for the past _596_ days. That's 1 year and 7 months of watching and leaving a comment on this video. When you think of habits, JustJeff is an inspiration to us
all.
