The form III verb looks suspicously like the doer form in Arabic. But it is, in fact, a totally separate verb form.

The form III veb has a meaning of mutuality. This means that the doer of the verb is doing the verb to another person or thing.
The initiator will be marked as the فاعل, while the thing done with will be the direct object.

The conjugation table is as follows:

|Command|Verbal Noun|Present Tense|Past Tense|
|فَاعَلَ|يُفَاعِلُ|مُفَاعِلَةٌ/فَعَالٌ|فاعِلْ|

And the doer/receiver pattern:

|Receiver Pattern|Doer Pattern|
|مَفَاعِلٌ|مُفاعَلٌ|
