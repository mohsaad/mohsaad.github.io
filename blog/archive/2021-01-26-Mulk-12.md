إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ يَخْشَوْنَ رَبَّهُم بِٱلْغَيْبِ لَهُم مَّغْفِرَةٌۭ وَأَجْرٌۭ كَبِيرٌۭ

Indeed, those in awe of their Lord without seeing Him1 will have forgiveness and a mighty reward.

# Arabic Breakdown

انَّ translates to "indeed", and is usally said with emphasis. الذين means "the ones who" or "those". It's kind of like هو, but more of a third person aspect. يخشون is a third person plural verb, meaning "they fear".
ربهم means "their Lord", of course, while بالغيب لهم  means "by/with the unseen for them". مغفرة is a noun meaning "forgiveness". واجر كبير  means great rewards, and is an adjectival phrase since the cases and
definitiveness match.

# Commentary

StudyQuran mentionms that everyone should have a fear of Allah (swt). There are two imstances of fear that StudyQuran mentions - one is the fear of punishment even though one doesn't see it, and the other instance
is a devotion to God so intense that one doesn't want to displease him. That because of love for Allah (swt), we don't want to even come close to displeasing him. And because of that fear, we will have forgiveness
for our sins and misdeeds.
