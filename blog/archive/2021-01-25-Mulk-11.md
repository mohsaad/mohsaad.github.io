فَٱعْتَرَفُوا۟ بِذَنۢبِهِمْ فَسُحْقًۭا لِّأَصْحَـٰبِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ

And so they will confess their sins. So away with the residents of the Blaze!

# Arabic Translation

ف translates to "so" or "then". In this case, I think it means "so". اعترف is the form VIII verb of عرف, which means "to know". That makes the form VIII
verb "to confess". ذنب means "sins", and the attached pronoun هم means "their". (It's preceded by ب  which means "by/with", but isn't translated in this case).

سحق means "to be far away". Again we have أَصْحَـٰبِ ٱلسَّعِيرِ, or the companions of the Blaze. It's preceded by لِ, which has multiple meanings including "to", but in
this case it means "with".

# Reflection

No commentary really exists for this verse, as it's mostly a continutation of the previous one (at least in StudyQuran). But it's especially interesting
that everyone confesses their sins eventually. Everyone is held accountable for their sins, and Allah (swt) tells us that everyone will admit to them
eventually. So why not admit and repent to them now, when you have the chance for forgiveness?
