I smoked a brisket a few weekends ago (2/23/2020) It took 10 hours, a lot of anxiety, and 100% belief that I was going to screw it up.

# Why brisket?

I've been obsessed with brisket since the first time I had it at Green Street Smoked Meats, in Chicago, IL. They had a halal brisket from Creekstone, and to this day it's one of the best tasting experiences I've ever had.

Unfortunately, brisket is smoked, and as it turns out, the smoker that they used also smoked pork on the same rack. So, we could never go back and eat there again, much to my mom and dad's disappointment.

I hadn't really thought about it since, until I was at home during my recovery from bunion surgery where I suddenly had a craving for brisket again. No idea why, but it happened and nothing was going to stop me from cooking it.

# What is brisket?

Brisket is a giant (14-16 lb) cut of meat coming from the lower, front portion of a cow.

It's very popular as a BBQ item, especially in Texas, where you can find lots of both homemade and restaurants serving brisket. In the rest of the country... not so much. I had never heard of it before

# So how do you do it?

You smoke it, of course!

In all seriousness, it's not something to be taken lightly. Smoking meat takes a long time, is incredibly tricky to get right, and requires a ton of patience and frustration and making sure you don't check the temperature every 5 minutes. It also requires knowledge of grilling and fire starting. I had absolutely none of this when I smoked my brisket.

There's a few types of smokers out there, including electric, offset, and vertical charcoal smokers. Being the challenging person I am, I decided to get a vertical charcoal "bullet" smoker which had the best flavor because it comes direct from the charcoal and the wood you burn along with it.

This smoker I ended up buying used for 100$ on Craigslist is a [Cuisinart 18-inch vertical smoker.](https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-COS-118-Vertical-Charcoal-Smoker/dp/B01GFLYWF6/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=cuisinart+vertical+smoker&qid=1582788810&sr=8-4)

It has two smoke racks, a water pan to collect drippings / for water to evaporate from, and two vents to control airflow through the smoker, and a door to put in more water/charcoal.

# What meat did you use?

I only eat halal meat, so it's kind of difficult to find a halal cut of meat that large. Usually most halal meat is imported from New Zealand, and so was the brisket I ended up using.

My brisket was a 7lb grass-fed Wagyu brisket, mostly stripped of the fat that usually comes on a brisket, from [First Light Farms](https://www.firstlight.farm/). As you can tell, it's pretty hefty:

I ended up using a basic rub from Safeway, which was mostly paprika, onion powder, salt and pepper. However, when rubbing, I definitely did not use enough of the spice - I think I should have used at least half of the spice mix from the shaker.

# How did you smoke the brisket?

Very difficult-ly, it turns out.

Smoking a brisket is really a test of patience and management. 99% of it is temperature regulation - you need your brisket to hit 190 - 200 Fahrenheit, but not so quickly as it drains the juices from the meat. So you have to essentially slow cook it - for 10 hours. Most guides recommend between 45-90 minutes per pound of meat, at somewhere around 225 degrees.

As my first time smoking something, of course, I knew absolutely none of this.

Well, not exactly - I knew what the internal temp needed to be, and I knew what the smoker temperature needed to be. Getting to that temperature, however, was a pain.

To start the fire in the grill, I filled a chimney starter (seen below) with some charcoal and put newspapers underneath. Lighting the newspapers allows the fire to travel upwards, slowly setting the charcoal on fire and getting the coals ready quickly.

![Chimney starter](https://i.ibb.co/DrnL1Y5/F0066895-17-D6-4398-9-DAB-94-F85-D0-FFA2-F.jpg)

What I did not know was that the coals in the starter are not enough to get a fire going. You need a lot of coals (and especially long burning ones) to get a fire going, and for it to stay there. There's ways of keeping a fire burning (including the minion method, which I eventually used.

## The Minion Method

The idea behind the method is to control the amount of air coming into the smoker, so the fire doesn't get too hot, but not also let it burn out too quickly. To use the minion method, fill the entire ring with unlit coals, as follows:

![Minion Method 1](https://i.ibb.co/PrZMmY0/Untitled-2.png)

Afterward, put a few hot coals (that you lit via the chimney starter) and spread them out:

![Minion Method 2](https://i.ibb.co/7CxrGQJ/Untitled-3.png)

With this method, apparently you can get up to 12-18 hours of hot coals, which is kind of insane.

Unfortunately, I did not use this method, so a lot of anxiety was created because I was constantly trying to adjust temperature up and down using wood or air to try and maintain the temperature. Also, throwing more coals in as need be instead of letting the fire burn every 30 minutes created a lot of anxiety and fear that I was screwing it up.

## Regulating temperature

Regulating temperature is the most important part of smoking a brisket. The temperature determines how fast the meat cooks, and so you have to keep track of two things:

1. The temperature of the smoker
2. The temperature of the meat

The one thing I learned doing this is to NOT trust the temperature that comes built-in to the smoker. Get a set of probes from Amazon (something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Inkbird-Wireless-Thermometer-Grilling-Rechargeable/dp/B076QDC5VL/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=bbq+temperature+probe&qid=1583638585&sr=8-9)) to keep track of the meat temperature. In my opinion, that's the most important part of smoking the brisket - keeping the temperature nice and constant.  Place one probe sideways into the brisket, and one hanging in the container to keep track of the environmental temperature.

But how do you increase or decrease the temperature? I found that there was three ways to affect the temperature:

1. Open/close the vents on the smoker
2. Add water to the water bowl underneath
3. Add charcoal/wood to the fire

The easiest way to regulate the temperature is to adjust the vents to allow more air to flow in, and pump up the charcoal fire. This should be done if the temperature falls below 200 F. Close the vents if the temperature gets too high, as this will allow the fire to "burn out" inside the smoker.

The second way is add water (hot or cold) to the water pan underneath the brisket. This has the effect of adding more moisture to the inside of the smoker, cooling down the environmental temperature. I think you should only do this sparingly, especially when you're getting the fire started.

The last way to keep the temperature constant is to add wood and charcoal. Wood will give you a very temporary increase in the temperature, while charcoal burns longer. An important thing is to make sure you have enough charcoal to keep it going past 20 minutes. These problems can mostly be avoided by using the minion method as described above.

When doing this myself, I ended up having to check the temperature every 15 minutes, which made me very anxious. A friend of mine came by with some temperature probes, which helped me relax and really take the pressure off looking at the thermometer every 5 minutes. Since I didn't use the minion method, it took a little longer to cook and maintain the temperature by adding charcoal or wood every 30 minutes or so.

It turns out after a few hours I had let the temperature fall to 175 (!!) so I decided to be lazy and bring up the temperature to 275 F for a while to make up for it. I think that helped cook it a bit faster.

## Wrapping the brisket and overcoming the stall

I asked for some butcher paper from the place I got the brisket from, and I wrapped the entire brisket in butcher paper to help keep the moisture in. I did this when I thought the brisket was stalling, but now that I think about it, it was really because the temperature of the environment was nowhere near hot enough to keep cooking the brisket.

![Butcher Paper](https://i.ibb.co/qpMyb6p/Untitled-4.png)

This is called the "Texas Crutch" and it's super useful for cooking a brisket, and overcoming the dreaded "stall". The stall is when the internal temperature of the brisket stops rising, and as a result people panic and try to increase the temperature of the brisket. This is *not good,* as it dries out the brisket and makes it hard and inedible. To get through the stall, you really just have to wait it out. Wrapping it in butcher paper helps decrease the amount of stall time, but it is 100% an exercise in patience.

## How'd it turn out?

Pretty well, I think!

![Brisket outside](https://i.ibb.co/F4hMq17/B35-A9-DA7-52-C6-40-FB-9689-D5-A566-A08-C1-D.jpg)

The outside of the brisket is called the "bark" and it ended up looking exactly like a real bark would. I think it could have been a little darker, but all in all it turned out well. The inside turned out quite wonderfully, in fact:

![Brisket internals](https://i.ibb.co/QvwCyCX/6-FE6-D6-AC-4050-4888-9704-46-AC88685371.jpg)

As you can see, there's the pink smoke ring around the inside of the meat, which gives it a nice smoky flavor. The meat wasn't as cooked as I had imagined it, although it was plenty flabby. Brisket is meant to be super flexible, and easy to tear off; this one wasn't as flexible and was a little harder to chew - meaning I definitely didn't cook it enough.

However, it's still safe to eat - I ended up taking it out of the smoker when the internal temperature hit 180 F, which is beyond the safe temperature of 160 F. Most people take theirs out of the smoker at 190 - 200 F, so I think I could have left it in a little longer.

## How'd it taste?

Interesting is the first way I'd describe it. It was definitely more rare than the brisket I had before, a bit harder to chew, a bit harder to work with. I don't think I put enough salt and pepper on it, and that definitely affected the taste quite a bit - and not enough spice on the outside either. But other than that, I really enjoyed it. I was surprised that I didn't screw it up too badly, and my friends who ate with me agreed that it was pretty good overall.

## What would you do next time?

- Definitely buy a temperature probe
- Use the minion method for starting the fire
- Use more rub on the outside
- Put a aluminum pan underneath the brisket to collect any drippings. These are extremely tasty and would do well as a sauce for the brisket.
- Make burnt ends! That's a recipe discussion for another day.
- Start earlier! And get the fire started a bit quicker.
- Keep the vents closed for the most part
- Use a different kind of wood (pecan/cherry is my next thought)
- Get someone experienced to help me out!
