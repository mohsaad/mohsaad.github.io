This shot is just crazy.

Tis photo by [sebastianmzh](https://www.skypixel.com/users/wolf-shatik) is convincing me to buy a drone, immediately.

It's perfect. The contrast of the train. The framing. The composition. Everything is just great.

Some more crazy drone shots can be found in this [article](https://www.boredpanda.com/best-drone-photography-contest-winners-2018-skypixel/?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=BPFacebook&fbclid=IwAR1vS4lyIp2z7ouF0awxkWvQ3LH3dvfW06kJsJO8QfY3l-29C0dY0Ds0lWY). Nothing popped out as much as this one though.
