There's a sign on the corner of the I-280 and I-101 interchange on a hill in Bernal Heights that says "DREAM".

Not many people know about it, despite driving past it every day. Most people are drawn to the billboard
advertising some hot new AI startup to notice it. Arguably, though, this is much more important.

The artist, Ana Teresa Fernandez, got her inspiration from a graffitied building right next to the sign that has the words "DREAM" on it. 
The graffiti itself is a tribute to the late Mike "Dream" Francisco, a graffiti artist in Oakland. It's a prescient
time in America, where people are held down by inequality and poverty, and cannot execute on their dreams. Yet maybe this sign is there
to inspire them to try anyways, with a message as old as time:

"Dare to Dream"
