I saw a post recently on someone writing out their monthly goals. I figured, since I'm on a plane with not much else to do, why not?

## Bike ride every morning

I think this is something I really want to do, since I'll be in California for half the time. I'll need to build up my stamina for half dome, anyways!

## Write a post at least once a week

This is to develop a writing habit. I think I'd like to summarize or work on a few small posts every week, just to get in the habit of posting on this blog. I'll make a post, then occasionally forget about it for a while, and I'd like to be more consistent.

## Memrise every morning

Have to keep up my Arabic!

## Finish up some old projects

I've got a backlog of projects that I half-started and never finished, and I'd like to use some of my time in California to finish those.
