Some notes from today's Jumuah.

* Try to keep up the habits from Ramadan
* Make sure you keep track of your internal state
  * i.e. it was easy to not argue with people or get angry during Ramadan
  * now it's a bit harder
  * if you find yourself getting angry or emotional, take a step back and ask why
* ask Allah (swt) to accept your Ramadan
  * the companions would ask Allah (swt) to accept their Ramadan for 6 months, and then
  the other 6 months they would ask to live to the next one
* keep up your Quran readings and ensure that you keep having a relationship with the Quran
