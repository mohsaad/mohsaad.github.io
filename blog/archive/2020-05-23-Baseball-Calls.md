I really like baseball. I used to play as a kid (which is very unusual for a Desi/South Indian kid, and actually, still is nowadays). Growing up in Chicago, there's a lot of Cubs and White Sox fans, but the teams I wanted to play on in Little League were always random teams
from across the US, and I ended up following the Athletics for some reason. (12 years later I'm living in the Bay so maybe it was a premonition). So I ended up watching a lot of Cubs games, and a lot of Athletics games, as both were two good teams at the time. (The 2005 White Sox fell apart soon after their World Series). It only took ~11 years for me to see one of my teams win a championship in 2016.

Anyways, the point of that was to say that I've watched a lot of baseball over the years, and I've seen a lot of calls. So here's some of my favorites.
