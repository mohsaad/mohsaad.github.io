My blog. Mostly focused on robotics, specifically state estimation (calibration and localization) and mapping, along with
a smattering of backend services.

I'll try to keep this technically focused - I used to talk about anything and everything, and I think that's a hard thing to balance.
Since this is meant to be more professional, I'll try to write content that matches that.

Happy reading!
