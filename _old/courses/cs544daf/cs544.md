title: CS 544&#58; Optimization for Computer Vision & AI
---

Here's a class taught by [David Forsyth](http://www.luthuli.cs.illinois.edu/~daf/) on optimization in the fall of 2017. His notes (retyped by me) are over here, mostly as a reference to myself.

* [Basic Continuous Optimization]({{ site.baseurl }}courses/cs544daf/cs544/week1)
* More basic continuous optimization
* Constrained optimization methods
* Gradient Boost
* Combinatorial Optimization
* Flow and cuts
* Alpha-Expansion, Alpha-beta swaps; Markov Random Fields as Cuts
* Stochastic Average Gradient
* Matchings
* Bipartite Graph Matching
* Dual Decomposition Methods
* ADMM
* ADMM for Discrete Problems
