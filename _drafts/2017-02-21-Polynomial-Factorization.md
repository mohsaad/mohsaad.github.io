title: Polynomial Factorization
---

Today, we'll be writing an algorithm to do polynomial factorization using Budan's method
for finding an upper bound on the number of roots in an interval $(l, r)$. Then, we'll use
Halley's method (an improvement on Newton's method) to figure out the roots in that interval.
