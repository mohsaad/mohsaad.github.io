Half Dome is one of Yosemite's premier attractions, with only 300 permits per day allowed. These permits are obtained through
a random lottery - and it's pretty hard to get one, especially on the weekends. I had applied for a permit this year, thinking
it would be cool to climb it before I went to grad school.

Then, COVID-19 hit.

Yosemite was closed for a few months, with Half Dome permits relatively stuck in an unknown situation. Would the park open up?
Would people be able to enter and hike Half Dome? The park was closed for 3 months until things got manageable with COVID-19 in
the state. But, unfortunately, the Half Dome Cables' installation was still delayed until June 5. Also, you couldn't get into
the park without a permit, which I don't think were given out until June 5.

My Half Dome permit was for... June 5.

My friends and I essentially had the park to ourselves.

It's really eerie to essentially have an entire place to yourself. Not going to lie, it's really cool to not have any crowds, not get held back by anyone except your own self.
It's almost like we were seeing the park the way nature intended it to be seen - without people, teeming full of life and without man.

As for the hike itself, it was difficult. I don't think we really estimated how steep the climb was, and definitely how long it would take to get down. We started
relatively late, but still made it to the top before thunderstorms rolled in. Thankfully they didn't hit us, but it was a worry for a while that we were going to get
rained on.

There's a lot of switchbacks on the trail going up, and it's also relatively steep to the point where I was super tired before we even reached the cables.
