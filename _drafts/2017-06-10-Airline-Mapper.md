One habit I've been trying to get in the hang of is writing every day about something. It doesn't have to be much, just an idea or something, but I just have to write it out.

A couple of days ago my cousin proposed to me an idea for an app that would mark your travels. I thought it was a neat idea, and something that's definitely implementable. But it also made me think of all the flights I've been on over the years, and how many miles I've travelled. So I decided to make a map using a bit of Javascript and HTML/CSS.


I also collected a couple of statistics about all my flights (or attempted to).

## Flights I've taken
* ORD - Heathrow
* Heathrow - Dubai
* Dubai - Karachi
* ORD - Providence
* ORD - Williamsburg
* ORD - Berkeley
* ORD - BOS
* Midway - OAK
* IAD - ORD
* ORD - SFO
* ORD - LAX

(it's actually not that many, lol)
