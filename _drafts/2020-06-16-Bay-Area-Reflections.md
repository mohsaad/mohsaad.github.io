title: Reflections on 3 years of living in the Bay Area
description: Some personal thoughts upon moving out.

Earlier this week, I moved out of the Bay Area to go to the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor for graduate school.
While driving, I thought about all the things I've learned and experienced and tried to grow from there. And there's
a lot. I don't think it's quite hit me yet, but there's a lot of things that I really enjoyed about the place, despite
it's shortcomings. People really hate the Bay Area because it's expensive and spread out, and that it can be hard to
find a real community that isn't just work. I think I found that, and that's why I look back on it positively.

Looking back at my first experience living in San Francisco, I was this weird, awkward 21 year old kid who didn't really know what to
do with his life. I'd never really lived outside of Illinois except for 2 internships. So I guess I wasn't totally unprepared. I didn't really
know anyone in SF, and as someone who had more or less become more religous over college, it was hard to find a community of people who were my
age at the masjid. (S/o to the Crescent Street masjid, though - that place was always kind to me, and I often would try to catch Fajr/Isha there
if possible.) I had come during Ramadan and almost immediately went back for the rest of Ramadan, which meant missing a lot of the community events
that popped up during then. In hindsight, that was probably not great - I knew a few people who had moved out at the same time who also didn't
know anyone and spent that first year lonely.

My first few days I spent meeting my new team and getting to know them a little bit. I had no idea how to take public transit, so I ended up walking
everywhere. This was a bad idea, as I ended up scaling some pretty large hills to get back to my apartment.

I had joined Iris Automation, and had never heard of them. Apparently they had liked my experience with ROS and C++, so they hired me
as one of their software engineers. I'm still really thankful to Alexander Harmsen, James Howard, and Somik Ghosh for giving me that
opportunity - in classic Saad fashion, I was indecisive about it until the last moment, at which point I decided to go for it. But it gave me
a fresh start, and a chance to really explore some opportunities and hobbies that I never thought I'd have.



As a graduation gift, I had gotten a Sony A6000 camera to learn photography and try and pick up a hobby so I wouldn't talk about papers and
coding all the time. I found that I really enjoyed photography, taking a couple of fairly cool pictures that were much better than my
phone at the time.
