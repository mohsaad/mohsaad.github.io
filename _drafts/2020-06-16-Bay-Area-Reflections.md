description: Some personal thoughts upon moving out.

Earlier this week, I moved out of the Bay Area to go to the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor for graduate school.
While driving, I thought about all the things I've learned and experienced and tried to grow from there. And there's
a lot. I don't think it's quite hit me yet, but there's a lot of things that I really enjoyed about the place, despite
it's shortcomings. People really hate the Bay Area because it's expensive and spread out, and that it can be hard to
find a real community that isn't just work. I think I found that, and that's why I look back on it positively.

I guess one thing that stands out to me is that it's really beautiful. I know the meme is that the Bay Area tech scene is filled
with people from the Midwest who haven't seen a real city for their lives, which is true, but there's something about SF that makes
it different. A lot of the houses are ripped straight outta 1920-1950s (thanks, NIMBYs) but that does give it character. There's tons
of nature options around, and plenty of things to see on a bike (and lots of climbs). Even the South Bay suburbs which I used to hate on
are plenty interesting, with quite a bit to see. After 1 year of living in San Mateo I didn't mind it all too much. Plus, if you want to leave,
Point Reyes is right there, Yosemite is pretty close, hell even Half Moon Bay / Santa Cruz / Central Coast isn't too far.

One other thing that I really want to highlight is *growth*. I think I grew up a lot in terms of what I was interested in and wanted to do
in my spare time. A lot of that was biking, but I also picked up photography, travel, and board games as well. But not only "fun" things - I
also realized I really like reading Arabic and Quran, and kind of revitalized my religion because of that. And I think a lot of that has to stem
by the people I surrounded myself with - who were similarly driven but also interested in making themselves better. You are the product of who
you surround yourself with, and I think surrounding myself with people who cared and wanted to push things also helped me a lot.

I really want to highlight that last part, as well as give a shout out to the people who I'm really thankful for in the Bay (and this is
not an exhaustive list, so if you don't find yourself on here, don't be offended!)
