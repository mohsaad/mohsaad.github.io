Hi! My name's Mohammad Saad, and this is my website/profile page/whatever.

I'm a student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, graduating with my B.S. in Electrical Engineering later this year. I do a lot of stuff, but my focus is in image processing and computer vision. 

I founded TAG-DSP, which stands for Technical Advancement Group - Digital Signal Processing. I co-head it with Dario Aranguiz, a graduate student also at the University of Illinois. We learn and try to implement digital signal processing on cool little projects. We've worked (or are trying to work on) projects, such as a Follow Me Drone. 

I'm also a part of [Student Space Systems](http://www.studentspacesystems.org/), where I work on mainly control systems for our rocket. I was a part of Avionics, working on Stabilization and Control Systems, such as Apogee Detection, a Reaction Control System, and State Estimation.

Finally, I'm also the [Muslim Student Association](http://www.msauiuc.org) webmaster. I just maintain the website.
