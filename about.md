Hi! My name's Mohammad Saad, and this is my website.

Right now I'm a research engineer at Sprite Robotics. I graduated from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.illinois.edu) with my [B.S. in Electrical Engineering](http://www.ece.illinois.edu/) in 2016. I focused on image processing and computer vision.

In the past, I've interned at [Rincon Research Corporation](http://www.rincon.com/), [The Aerospace Corporation](http://www.aerospace.org/), and CentraLytics, Inc.

I founded TAG-DSP, which stands for Technical Advancement Group - Digital Signal Processing. We learn and try to implement digital signal processing on cool little projects. Right now we're trying to build algorithms for music visualization using frequency analysis.

I'm also a part of [Student Space Systems](http://www.studentspacesystems.org/), where I work on mainly control systems for our rocket. Currently I'm attempting to apply computer vision to determine attitude onboard a rocket in real time. In the past, I worked on stabilization and control systems, such as Apogee Detection, a Reaction Control System, and State Estimation.

Feel free to check out my [CV](/Mohammad_Saad_2017_CV.pdf), or contact me!
