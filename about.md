Hi! My name's Mohammad Saad, and this is my website.

Right now I'm a software engineer at the [Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/). I graduated from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.illinois.edu) with my [B.S. in Electrical Engineering](http://www.ece.illinois.edu/) in 2016. I focused on image processing, computer vision, and a bit of GPU programming.

In the past, I've worked/interned at [Iris Automation](http://www.irisonboard.com), [Sprite Robotics](http://www.petronics.io), [Rincon Research Corporation](http://www.rincon.com/), [The Aerospace Corporation](http://www.aerospace.org/), and CentraLytics, Inc.

I enjoy [photography](https://www.instagram.com/mohsaad023) and [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/24938440) in my spare time.

Feel free to check out my [CV](http://mohsaad.com/misc/Mohammad_Saad_2018.pdf), or contact me via [email](mailto:mohammad.saad@outlook.com)!
