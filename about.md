Hi! My name's Mohammad Saad, and this is my website.

Right now I'm a software engineer at [Iris Automation](http://www.irisonboard.com). I graduated from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.illinois.edu) with my [B.S. in Electrical Engineering](http://www.ece.illinois.edu/) in 2016. I focused on image processing, computer vision, and a bit of GPU programming.

In the past, I've interned at [Sprite Robotics](http://www.petronics.io), [Rincon Research Corporation](http://www.rincon.com/), [The Aerospace Corporation](http://www.aerospace.org/), and CentraLytics, Inc.
