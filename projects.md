In my undergraduate (and spare) time, I've worked on a few things, mostly related to computer vision. I'll try to put in project pages for all of these hopefully soon enough.

* GPU-Accelerated Convolutional Neural Network
* Open Source OS
* Anomaly Detection Using Computer Vision
* Acoustic-Driven Car Seat Localization
* Follow-Me Drone
* Reaction Wheel Pendulum
* A Critical Survey of Face Detection Frameworks
* Heart Rate Extraction using the Android System
* A Triangular Framework for Encoding Data in Images
* Space Invaders
* Parkd
* Santa's Little Helpers
* Cyberball
* MHacks Music
